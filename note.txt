I don't know when I'll release the code to these. 
Probably when I will prove that the computational possibility exists in every programming language.
And I'd go as far to say that in math itself.

Meaning if you would count your-self made up random numbers with 5 decimals, with the algorithm I created, You would get another set of repeating numbers.
