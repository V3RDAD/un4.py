# un4.py
Random number bug implemented into python. The same way as seen In UN_4 batch file.

The same system as seen in the batch file used to ONLY count with random numbers and variables.
Will result; (in) THE SAME NUMBERS THAT REPEAT AS SEEN IN UN_4.BAT. while(true).

## note
I don't know when I'll release the code to these. 
Probably when I will prove that the computational possibility exists in every programming language.
And I'd go as far to say that it exists in math itself.

Yes I go as far as to imply that;
if you would count your-self made up random numbers with 5 decimals,
with the algorithm I created, You would get a set of repeating numbers.

##subnote
This may be a Geometric algorhitmic, algabraic shortcut.
